[---------- RME/VME Render View Controls ----------]

Render control buttons:
[---------------------------------------]
Page up / Page Down: adjust ambient light intensity
HOME / END: Adjust Directional light intensity (right mouse button down + mouse to move light source around)
LEFT/RIGHT Arrows: Decrease/Increase roughness (make shinier, less shiny)
A/D: Rotate Environment Map (HDRI)
R: Reset lighting, roughness and environment map rotation to default.
S: Show/hide skeleton
T: show ambient reflections only (debugging)
P: scale diffuse by 1/PI (debugging)
1: render like WH/WH2
2: render like Troy
3: render like Rome2/Atilla/Thrones (Variation 1, debugging)
4:render like Rome2/Atilla/Thrones (Variation 2, debugging)
There is no renderer for Three Kingdoms at the moment, though it might DRAW (badly) anyuway

To load a VMD, just use File->Open. Everything else is autoloaded from game+mod .packs (except .material.xml files, they are not yet parsed so standard textures are used).
Then you check off "MESH" nodes in the tree for the models you want rendered.
ANIM PLAYER: should load converted ANIM files directly from disk, unless I have switched that off, and there is animation search  by multiple key substrings.
The coolest test:
Load Malekith "def_malekith.variantmeshdefinition" when you test the VMD viewer, check "body",  "sword" and "shield" and the play "hu1d_sws_malekith_stand_idle_01.anim" (write: "male kit id"* in the Animation field in the selector/player box, click the little arrow or press F4 to search/filter).
